* Can a program write like a poet?
* Writing can be transfer of information
 * But poetry is more than just that
 * The "Story" rather than just the bits
* How?
 * Look at the passage and essentially replace words
 * apply "traits"
 * variable constraints upon replacement
 * Word coice
 * Synonyms
  * e.g. words that mean like 'dog' and begin with the letter 'd'
 * Also "Senses"
 * DSL for generating text
 * Sources
  * Wordnet synonym dicitonary
  * Common words

  * Literatiure
  * 15GB running imates
 * Personality traits
  * Analyses a phrases and looks at words in personality categories
 * Algorithmic rhyming using phonetic dictionary
  * Calculates score based on back-to-front comparison, length etc
 * Echoes
  * Phrases that sound imilar but don't rhym
 * N-grams
 * Final word adjustments
  * Hard because of English irregularities
* Performance
 * Parallel word and phrase choice

* Semantic hints help
* Works best when it has a rough idea of what you want to say ("sesnse")
 * Parsing a piece of text and inferring meaning hasn't been done successfully yet
* Debugging is hard
 * Non-deterministic
 * Get a 'sense' that something is wrong
* Software engineering
 * This is a big project with mostlu unknowns, few patterns
 * Very different to agile methodologies
 * Software development has become *product development*
 * Inkwell is not a 'product'
  * Not necessarily aware of what it's going to do
  * This is *real* software development
