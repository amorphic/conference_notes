# It's Complicated
## Adrian Cockcroft

* In life things are complicated... but we deal with them
* Complicated often means there are too many parts, we can't intuit behaviour
 * Perhaps it's complex but we can grok it
 * Perhaps we never will
* Intuitive is a 2 yr old w/iPhone
* When organising a large group of people
 * The Little Prince: "teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea..."
 * Read the "Freedom and Responsibility Culture" Netflix deck
* Optimisation
 * Optimise for speed, flexibility and evolution
 * Optimise for efficiency when a significant cost driver has stopped evolving
* Imposing process drives away talent
 * When doing so, question why? How does it grow?
 * Better to instill purpose. Allow people to find the way.
* Jamshid G: "Systems Thinking..."
* Microservices
 * Don't distribute service ownership.
 * Team owns a service. Maintains an API. Supports in prod.
 * APIs need to be built so that they *could* be public (Amazon)
 * Systems Thinking approach: apply the pain where it gets best benefit.
 * Devs should be on call!
* Microservices
 * Monoliths only simple on the outside
 * Microservices enforce clean interfaces which can be hidden in monolith.
 * Github: spigo
 * How to trace flows?
 * Read the google dabber paper
  * zipkin (openzipkin), phosphor
  * transactions, parents, spans
