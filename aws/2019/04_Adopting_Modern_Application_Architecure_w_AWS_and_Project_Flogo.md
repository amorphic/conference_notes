* Event Processing
    * Stream - Aggregate/Filter noise
    * Integrate - One at a time, add to a database etc
    * Complex Event Processing - Correlation/Rules/Inference
* Insight Approaches
    * Streaming/Data Aggregation
        * Mediean/mean/time-weighted averages etc
        * Sometimes this is sufficient
    * Machine Learning
        * Classifying large quantities
        * Broad set of patterns need to be detected
        * Suffient data required

    * Rules
        * Real-time Contextual Decisions
    * Native Machine Learning
* Why ML at the edge?
    * Quantitiy of data - reduce amount of data transferred
    * Lag - reduce time to make decisions
    * Connectivity - make decisions without going to the cloud
