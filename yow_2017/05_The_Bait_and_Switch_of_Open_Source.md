# The Bait & Switch of Open Source
## Katrina Owen

>Open Source sells itself as being about technical problemsâ€”delightfully thorny technical problems, at that. However, successful projects are filled with people, which introduces a whole different set of problems that programmers often have not developed the skills to handle.

* [Exercism](http://www.exercism.io/)
    * Started as a way of automating manual parts of coding problems
        * Solved a small problem
        * No intention to get bigger
    * Put online fo fun
* Unprepared for success
    * Conferences
    * No idea how to
        * triage issues
        * communciate problems
        * design
        * copy writing
        * product management
        * communitey management
        * conflict resolution
        * delegation
    * Didn't want to kill project
        * It was obviously valid
    * No idea how to distinguish between
        * Activity that would move project forward
        * Activity that wouldn't
* Lessons
    * How do you decide what to do nest?
        * Antipattern: look at first thing and say Yes or No
            * Take easily accessible information, mis in hopes + dreams and run with it
            * "You should have X feature"
            * Ignores problem you're currently having
        * Alternative: make decisions that amplify your strengths
            * Cold War
                * Old: a shopping list to counter the Soviet's 
                * New: look at Soviet weakness (lack of $) and use strength to counter (new technology they can't afford to counter)
    * Bait & Switch
        * You fix a problem
        * Your share your solution
        * Then you're an open source maintainer
        * You have 99 problems
    * Tactics vs Strategy
    * Narrow framing of solutions
        * Explore the problem space
        * Generate a lot of questions
            * Let questions feed questions
            * Allow the scope to vary
            * These will allow you to find the real problems
        * Ignore gut instinct that someone is wrong
            * They're most certainly right about something
            * They might have info that you don't have
    * Explored at higher level
        * 2 problems:
            1. Product: Exercism.io
            2. Project: github page
        * People using product didn't care about the project
        * "Who is Exercism for?" - what are they getting out of it?
            * Explored at higher level helped a lot:
                1. Newbies: Learning code from scratch
                2. Polyglots: Coders learning idimoatic code in a new language
                3. Artisans: Dig in the craft of programming, obsessing about readability or performance
        * Teaching vs Learning
            * Exercism doesn't do either
            * Exercism gets you past the awkward phase when you're
            * Fluency without Proficiency
            * So don't cater for Artisans. Newbies and Polyglots
    * Interesting questions are "squishy" ones
        * Conversations are best thing about Exercism
        * But it is fragile
            * Lots of negative, demotivating feedback.
            * People give bad advice
            * Commenting on code is hard, makes user vulnerable
    * Use this knowledge to re-evaluate earlier decisions (made accidentally)
        * Linear progression
            * Not always how people learn - some people have previous knowledge etc
        * Logo
    * 18 months of asking questions and working out what to do
    * Open Source Project problems
        * Too much work for too few people
            * Burnout
        * Scales horizontally
            * Tracks operate independently
            * Some work could be done to scale across tracks
        * Key is to attracting maintainers
            1. Not enough, guranteed to be orphaned
            2. Starts to work but not enough
            3. Guaranteed quick response, begins snowball affect
        * Want Contributers -> Maintainers so Maintainers can move on guilt-free
        * Scaling is a marketing exercise in marketing
            * Enticing problems attract devs
            * Managing conversations keeps people happy
        * Support indicates what docs are required
    * Human interaction is hard but everything
        * Powerful upside
* Resources

    * Decision Making
        * Good Strategy Bad Strategy
        * Decisive
        * A Beautiful Question
    * Communication
