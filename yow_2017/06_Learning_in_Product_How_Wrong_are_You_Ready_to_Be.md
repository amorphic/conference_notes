# Learning in Product: How Wrong are You Ready to Be?
## David Hussman

> While many Scrum teams talk proudly about progress, fewer engage is rich discuss about product. Many teams who become more confident in progress, or getting work done, often embrace the more ambiguous question of product, or “Are we meeting the needs of our customers”, with some customers buying, by paying for subscriptions, and others buying in, by showing (and glowing about) their use of the system.
> In this session, I’ll share experiences helping companies adopt a customer and product / services approach. From small digital product companies to large enterprises who are IT focused, I will present an approach for moving to or augmenting an existing move towards impact driven work.
> Topics that will be covered include: mapping teams to products and services, early product discovery, blending product discovery and product delivery, and if there is enough time, ideas for doing these things at scale. If we run out of time, there is always the hallways, where some of the best conversations take place. Feel free to stop me and chat me up. All I ask is that you bring your curiosity and skepticism, but leave any cynicism behind.

* You are Product Engineers
    * Software Engineering is only part of your job
* Follow Product over Process
    * Complex organic systems become fragile when you add process
    * When people get scared they add process
* Music Production
    * Learn how to be good or better
    * Tough conversations about which songs were wrong
    * What I learned from Prince
* Produce Products and Services
    * How *wrong* was our last *delivery*?
    * How are we *measuring wrongness*?
    * Burndown used to measure value, no just stuff done
        * *"How many points were valuable?"*
        * Velocity is *speed* __and__ *vector*
    * Product Arrogance
        * Difference between what people need and what you 
* Why not view process is in a less binary way?
    * Not just Waterfall vs Agile
        * Traditional/Certain/Known/Construction/Productization
        * vs
        * Contemporary/Uncertain/Unknown/Exploration/Experimentation
    * Examples
        * Some projects (SAP install) is largely *known*
        * Some projects (Research/science) is largely *unknown*
* Product Communities
    * Map Teams to Products
        * To help foster "Just enough process
    * Easy when 1:1
        * Full Stack
    * Harder when multiple teams and products
        * Backend vs Frontend
    * Problems are across Teams/Backlogs/Sprints
        * E.g. Old backend vs new frontend
* Early Discovery
    * No more than 10% of time
    * Big upfront discovery is antipattern
    * Early Discovery -> Design/Discovery cycle
    * E.g. Why & Who
        * What does future success look like?
            * Build something in a week that homeless kids can use to find a bed to sleep in
            * Old system only updates daily, but it delivers immediate value
        * Who do you learn from or about?
            * What do they value?
            * What is meaningful and valuable to them?
            * Customer Centered Discovery
            * Not jsut a "user"
        * Where are you going to start learning?
            * Not thinking about "v1"
            * New planning dimension: "Customer Journey"
        * Can use story maps
            * Interaction Design
            * Doesn't work when there's no human dimension
                * Spend time eliminating uncertainty
* Changing the question
    * From "What is it going to cost us?" to "What's our next big investment?"
    * If you get a $100k grant how would you spend the first $10k?
* Establishing Cadence
    * Balance Discovery and Delivery
    * But who are we doing this for and why?
    * Not about getting more done faster, about learning more faster
    * Discovery Cadence
        * Think sprint + 1
        * Customer Learning, Talking to people
        * Prototyping
    * Next idea:
        * Discovery/Delivery are more blended
        * Could we fade the amount of Discovery/Delivery depending on what is needed in a given iteration
    * Product
        * Subjective: Intercom - talk direct to customers (stateful conversation)
        * Objective: Mixpanel - are they doing what we want?
* Responsive Engineering
    * Impact Driven Development
        * If I work on something
        * Product verification over Code Proliferation
    * Hierarchy
        Product: Product-Driven Development
        UX: Story-Driven Development
        Code: Test
* Intuition Engineering
    * Have computers solve the discrete engineering
    * Allow people to solve the things our brains can process
* How
    * Measuring Impact over Counting Story Points
    * Product Validation over Getting Work Done
    * Learning over Commitments
        * Is it so bad ot miss a commitment if you learned something?
    * "Too Big" over "How big?"
    * Investing over Budgeting
        * Stop "we have to get this done because $"
        * Stop thing
    * Story Maps over Epic Stories
    * User Experiences over Single Stories
    * Customer Journies over 
    * Talking about what we've done over Telling people what they should do

    * *"Product is any thing you create that affects other people"*
