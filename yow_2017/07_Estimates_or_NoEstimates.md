# Estimates or NoEstimates?
## Woody Zuill

> “The only sure thing about forecasts is that they are WRONG” – James P. Womack and Daniel T. Jones. Estimates have been the bane of software development projects for decision makers, managers, and programmers alike for decades. Managers/Customers want to know: When will it be done? How much will it cost? Which project should we do? Programmers are told: “A professional can do meaningful estimates”, and “We won’t hold you to the estimate”, and yet they often are.

> It’s my contention that estimates are often not useful for this purpose, and even worse they can misinform the decisions they are meant to support. Do we really need estimates? Is simply “getting better” at estimates worthwhile? Can we live without them? Will things be better without them? I don’t have answers for you, but I’ve worked with “no estimates” for over 8 years and I’m still alive and doing well. We’ll explore the idea of estimates, what they are, why they are pervasive in the programming world, how they might be harmful, and see if we can start a dialog about finding a better way.

* #NoEstimates
    * We should be able to safely question the status quo
    * The current state if affairs and practices in our workplaces
* We bet the farm on guesses
* Very specific types of estimates for very specific purpose
    * Estimates (guesses) or [time, cost, effort, complexity] regarding a [described] piece of software [feature, bugfix, product] to be worked on.
* Time
    * Work Time (or Effort)
        * The amount of time to do the actual work
    * Elapsed (Cycle) Time or Duration
        * The amount of time that passes from twhen we first start on some work until it is completed
    * How long would it take to write your name on a white index card 
* Estimates result in (weak) information
    * We use it to make decisions
        * Project A or B?
        * Which feature?
        * More/less  people?
        * More/less  money?
    * We believe that we must know something about the time or cost to make these decisions
    * But we're making the decisions based on guesses
    * *"It's better to know nothing than something that ain't so"*
* Dysfunctinal Pattern: Cycle of Continuous No Improvements
    * Pattern
        1. nth Iteration
        2. Retrospective
            * Estimates were off
            * Requirements were changing
        3. Try to get better at things in 2.
    * Symptoms vs Problems
        * They were taking placebos
    * It's About the Unknowns
* Questions
    * *"Transformation comes more from pursuing profound questions that seeking practical answers"*
    * Look for a better question!
* Image how great things could be if we had no limitations?
    * Illusion of Control Bias: Desire for control and certainty
        * Time
        * Cost
        * Schedule
        * Value illusion of control over dealing with things as the are.
    * Can we improve our chance at *Wonderful* if we give up our pursuit for control?
    * If we're doing a lot of estimates there may be a hidden problem.
        * How much work does it take before we have enough understanding for a decent estimate?
    * Sunk Cost falacy
        * Value sticking with what we've alreayd spent money on.
        * Over cutting our loses and trying something else.
    * We don't need help making decisions
        * We need help making good decisions
        * COnfirmation Bias
            * We value information that agrees with what we already believe
            * Over opinions and data that disagrees with our beliefs
    * Do the things we think we want act as a hardening agent?
        * On Time and On Budget?
            * No - measure Impact. Deliver at least what is expected.
            * Encourages "creative accounting"
                * Feature cuts
                * Not recording hours
                * Working late
            * Choice-supportive bias
    * If the type of decisions we are making are
* Are there alternatives to estimates?
    * *"The object isn't to make art, it's to be in that wonderful state which makes art inevitable"*
    * Make it easier for everyone to work rather than than focus on making good software
    * Be certain e have an encironment of discovery where great solutions are inevitable
    * Learn to control our urge to control things
        * We don't know the outcomes
        * *"The fear of losing Control is a big barrier to change"*
        * *"Do the most important thing until either it ships or it is the no longer the most important thing"*
    * Deadlines are fine if we treat them like newspapers
        * Deliver whatever we can meaningfully deliver *today*
