# Accelerate Your Development with Gemini API

- Text-to-Speech
    - Pro & Flash
    - Control emotion and style
    - Generate conversations with multiple distinct voices
    - Chat API
- Gemini native audioi models
    - 2 models:
        - dialog
        - thinking dialog: pauses to think for more detail
    - Natural voices
    - Multilingual
    - Contextual understanding
    - Live API
- Other models
    - Gemini Diffusion
        - Faster than current LLM
    - Deep Think
- Gemini surfaces
    - Consumers
        - Apps 
    - Devs
        - API 
    - Business/Enterprise
        - Workspace
- Gemini API Workflow
    - RAI filters
        - Safety + copyright
        - Configurable
    - Foundational Models
    - Tools
        - URL Context: supply URLs for RAG
            - Response specifies content obtained from URLs
        - Function calling
            - Sync and async
        - Grounding
        - Code exec
        - Structured outputs
- Gemini API Features
    - Multimodal
        - YouTube link support
        - 3 media resolution settings
        - Dynamic fps
        - Video clipping
        - Image segmentation
    - Long context
        - 2M Pro
        - 1M Flash
    - Context caching
        - Passing context can cost a lot
        - Explicit and implicit
            - Either specifically tell the model to cache or let the API decide 
        - Tokens
            - Min 1024 tokens for Flash
            - Min 2048 tokens for Pro
        - Tokens counting
- Text generation
    - Multimodal inputs
        - Document understanding
        - Bounding boxes
        - Image segmentation

    - Set system instructions
- Media gen
    - Gemini 2.0 Flash Preview Image Gen
        - Text and/or image input
        - Teat and or image gen
        - Conversational image editing
    - Imagen 3
    - Veo 2
- Live API
    - "realtime" low latency
    - Stream audio and video
- Agent architecture
    - Model: reason over goals, determine plan, generate response
    - Tools: Fetch datam erform actions or transactions by calling other APIs or services
    - Orchestrations: Maintain state (including the approach used to plann), tools, data provided/fetched etc
- Gemini thinking models
    - Allocate `thinking_budget`
- Best practice for agentic solutions
    - Start with Clear Objectives: defines what you want your agent ot achieve
    - Iterative Dev: Build and test in small increments
    - Robust Tooling: Ensure functions are reliable and handle errors
    - Prompt Engineering
    - Leverage Thought Summaries
    - Focus on User Experience
