* Learning
	* "Comfortable" learning is stimulating but not necessarily learning
	* Delayed recall
	* Flashcards etc
	* Learning a differnet language
		* Repeat back in terms of known language ("that's like X in Python")
		* Makes you better at the language you know
	* Believing you are inherently good at something won't help you get better
* Fixed vs Growth Mindset
	* The "smart kid" who thinks effort is something dumb people need to do
  	* Failure
		* Fixed: a source of anxiety
		* Growth: a source of learning, temporary setback
	* Affects your ability to handle setbacks
	* Small cues can affect:
		* "You're so talented!"
		* "You must have worked so hard!"
	* The growth mindset is fact
		* There is no limitation to learning or skills
		* The brain is elastic
* Tendencies
	* Adopt Fixed Mindset in the "important" things that matter
		* Fear of failure
	* Adopt Growth Mindset in the "easy" things you supposedly don't care so much about
* ToDo
	* Find what makes you feel dumb
	* Be "Strategically" dumb - adopt a Growth Mindset
