# Scissors-Paper-Rock your classroom with differentiated projects
## Renee Noble

* http://girlsprogramming.network
	* Range of ages (10-18)
	* Range of skills/experiences
	* Range of teacher backgrounds
	* All students need to go home having achieved something (difficult but fun!)
* Previous attempts
    * Slides
		* Some get ahead - get bored, distrat others
		* Some fall behind
		* Workbooks are better
	* Packaged/Boilerplate
		* E.g. Giving all html + css to learn js
		* Kids can't repeat, don't understand it all
	* Starting with the idea rather than the narrative
		* Teaching "arduino" or "networking"
		* Rather than "make thing X" (that happens to use arduino or networking)
	* Pygame
		* Can be hard to set up
	* Green Eggs and Ham
		* 5/10 mins lecture, 1 line of code
		* Not enough coding
* A basic project for every level
    * 3 versions of the same project for varying levels of understanding
	* Start with a "fun" quiz to categorise:
		* Beginner: nothing
		* Intermediate: variables, if statements
		* Advanced: for loops etc
	* Each level has bonus activities along the way
		* Require no lectures
		* Not required to advance (so kids who don't do them don't miss out)
		* Keeps everyone at a similar place
	* Extensions
		* Keep the project going forever
		* Re-arrange, add concepts etc
* Designing a project
	* Fun
	* Achieveable (good enough is fine)
		* Some ideas will need to time to absorb
	* All steps to get from start -> finish
	* Aim for MVP. Everything else is bonus!
	* "Concept Golf"
		* Scoring system per concept
		* Total shows how complex a concept is
		* Some concepts effectively become "free" as they level up
			* Print is 0 points for intermediate
		* Some concepts always cost the same
			* Making a creative decision always costs X points no matter how good you are
    * Break it down into steps
* Bonuses
    * Beginner
		* Ascii art instead of text
		* Time.sleep to simulate "thinking"
		* More functionality (Lizard Rock Scissor Paper Spock)
	* Intermediate
		* Matches in dictionary
	* Advanced
		* Classes/Objects etc
