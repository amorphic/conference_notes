# Using Formal Methods to Eliminate Exploitable Bugs
## Kathleen Fisher

* Better now than previously
 * More power
 * More automation
  * boolean formulas
  * SAT solvers
 * More infrastructure - cloud tools
 * Complexity and scale
  * makes it hard to reason about all of the uncommon cases (1 in a million cases)
  * tooling required
* Drone hacking
 * airhack
  * de-auth existing clients
  * replicate existing client
 * original devs wanted to ensure always able to connect (awol quadcopter
  * security not their concern
 * SMACCMCopter
  * http://smaccmpilot.org
  * upgrade proc
  * Free RTOS
  * HW Abstraction Layer
  * unikernels (v2)
  * Features
   * Memory safe
   * Ignores malformed messages
   * Ignores non-authed messages
   * All good messages acted pon
* Definition
 * Based on math 
 * Machine-checkable
 * Capable of proving properties of code and models
* Practically impossible
 * sel4 Micorkernel
 * General purpose operating system microkernel.
 * 10K LoC required 480K LoP (!)
 * 13 person years to build
* Impediments
 * Expertise (<5k experts worldwide)
 * Effort (but compare to potential problems if things go wrong, eg aviation)
 * Performance
 * Delay
  * But automated methods at lower end of scale becoming feasible as part of standard testing
   * facebook INFER checks for null pointer exceptions and resource leaks
