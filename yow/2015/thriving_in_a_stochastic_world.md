* Thriving in a Stochastic World
** Don Reinertsen

* Deterministic and stochastic mindsets differ significantly.
 * Waterfall is poorly suited for a stochastic environment
* Growth of Uncertainty
 * Shortened development time improves the quality of requirements
  * ...because they haven't had time to change
 * Cruise missile arrives where you want it to
  * ...because the target doesn't change
  * "Waterfall"
 * Air-air missle
  * Moves at mach 4, target moves at mach 2
  * Target is uncertain.
  * Go really fast and stay pointed at the target
  * "Agile"
 * Bad strategies
  1. Plan *more*
   * Obviously wrong. Lack of planning is not the problem.
  2. Avoid variability
   * Select low-variability and avoid high-variability
    * Less effort to implement but less positive outcomes
    * Example: improving grades by stopping maths/science classes and doing more phys ed classes
   * Implementing a buffer
   * Essentially Redefining a bad outcome as a good outcome
   * Example: making a "B" grade the 
   * But this doesn't change 
   * Schedule buffers convert possible delay into *certain* delay
  3. Select high-variability but *mask* variability
   * Adding robustness always comes at cost
    * Chaos + turbulence is unavoiadble
    * Example: sailing, wind is unavoidable
     * You can pull in more sail to avoid
     * But you will go slower and lose races
    * Playing it safe will mean competitors can get an edge
* Nassim Taleb - Anti-fragile
 * Most of us think fragility means:
  * Uncertainty = Worse Performance
  * Certainty = Better Performance
 * Opposite of fragile is actually a system that performs *better* in the presence of uncertainty
 * Rooted in financial markets: options
  * In options: higher variability (chaos) 
  * In manufacturing: lower variability 
 * So uncertainity combined with an asymmetric payoff function is profitable
* How to generate asymmetric payoffs in prod development
 * Reduce economic damage from bad outcomes
 * Increase economic gains from good incomes 
 * Fast feedback is required for both
  * Incremental product development: small step forward with MVP
   * Get a new piece of information
    * Proceed or Pivot
    * Shutdown unproductive options sooner
    * Add resource to productive options sooner
    * This is a payoff asymmetry decision!
  * Idea of "buying information in small batches" is through all new tech (DevOps etc as well)
  * This is the Value of Feedback
   * Like betting on a horse race in which the horses are already running
    * Take money off horses that our out of the race
    * Add money to those who look promising
* Payload Management
 * What is the indication of success?
  * Waterfall: Meeting cost, performance, schedule targets set at the beginning of the project
  * Agike: Making good economic choices "Is everything we did more valuable then everything we chose not to do?"
   * Did we fully exploit the gifts of economically valuable information we were given as we went?
   * Old style: try to ignore the new information because it breaks your success criteria (sticking to the plan)
* How to achieve this
 * People need to understand system level economic consequences of their acitons
 * Push understanding of economic consequences to a low level in the org
 * Feed information down so that people can make good economic decisions
* Warfighting:
 * Commanders who try to obtain certainity will *fail*. War is inherently uncertain.
 * Uncertainity is a place where we must not only survive but *thrive*
 * Required:
  * Situational awareness
  * Encourage quick aassessment
  * Decide with partial information (if you have 80% of the required information and haven't acted you are squandering advantage)
  * Communicate intent, at least two levels deep:
   * Not 'be on the hill at 10am'
   * 'Be on the hill in 10 am because X is going to happen and you need to do Y so we cna achieve Z'
   * Be able to shift focus quickly
* Books
 * Developing Products in Half the Time
 * Managing the Design Factiry
