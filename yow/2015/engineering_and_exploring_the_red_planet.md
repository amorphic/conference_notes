# Engineering and Exploring the Red Planet
## Anita Sengupta and Kamal Oudrhiri

* Why?
  * Mars was like Earth once
  * Mars is our best bet for colonising worlds beyond Earth
    * Gravity
    * Resources
  * Need to explore surface
    * Olympus mons - 3 times as high as Everest
* Landed successfully 7 times
  * But it is hard due to atmosphere
  * Decellerate 30k mph to 0 in 7 mins.
* Evolution in rovers - larger to carry more instrumentation
* Parachute
  * Impossible to simulate because of difference in atmosphere
  * Simulated in Computational Fluid Dynamics
  * Proved physically in small scale (~3%)
  * Used high-speed image processing to analyse
* Sol 200
  * Wow
