# Level Up: Quality, Security, and Safety

* Security is an emergent property, not a component property
* Quality isn't an issue... until it is
    * It's not natural to ask _"what could possiby go wrong?"_
* Dogma is anathema to quality
    * 100% code coverage
        * An absolute: people will work around it, e.g. not handling errors
* Root cause matters
    * Understanding why rather than changing something and having the problem go away.
* Responsibilty -> Accountability -> Ownership
* Instill
    * Specs as Communication
    * Early requirements analysis
    * Early domain expertise
    * Culture of account
