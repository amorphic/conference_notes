* Autonomy
    * Alightnment vs autonomy is a false economy
    * Stages of communications
        * Transmitted
        * Received
        * Understood
        * Agreed
        * Converted to useful action
    * What works:
        * Catchball
            * "Back and forth dialog"
            * Vertical and lateral
            * Every alignment tool is at most a mechanism to facilitate this
* Hypergrowth requires different assumptions
    * Can't rely on cultural osmosis
        * New people outnumber veterans
        * Default culture is not what exists
        * Becomes what people bring
        * Uncontrolled culture
    * Can't assume stable teams
        * Normally we define the team for the work
        * Things change too quickly
        * Building teams is hard due to cultural issues above
    * Doesn't work
        * Presumptive team splitting
            * Because we think we're going to need it
            * Because the size is "too big"
            * YAGNI - adds complexity that increases cost and you might not need it
            * Phenomena
                * Unclear Mission
                * Missing Capabilities
                * Unclear Roles
                * Unclear rhythm
    * Works
        * Structure Follows Strategcy
            * Stable when strategy is stable
            * Flexible when strategy is flexible
            * Tribes are stable, squads are flexible
    * Need deliberate culture
* Consulting companies are faster at building high-performing teams
    * Because time is money
    * WHat matters
        * Same training, same assumptions
            * No need to negotiate roles, rituals, etc
            * Eg Thoughtworks University
                * 5 weeks learning the TW way of working
        * Or rely on shared assumptiong
            * Strict hiring criteria
            * Much more involved at onboarding (4-6 weeks)
        * Focus on craft, not mission
            * Enthusiasm for purpose doesn't compensate for lack of skill
            * Teams of competent professionals rather than enthusiastic novices
            * Consultants focus on craft because clients aren't that interesting
            * Example activities
                * Coding dojos
                * Hack night
                * Training sessions
                * Mob code review
                * Brownbag sessions
    * Typial Lifetime
        * Consulting
            * Weeks -> Months
        * Product Company
            * Months -> Years
        * If it hurts, do it more often
