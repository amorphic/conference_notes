# The Origins of Opera and the Future of Programming
## Jessica Kerr

* Its easier to build something new than to understand something which exists
    * E.g. Javascript frameworks
    * But then the mental model which is *obvious* to the Creator must be understood by the *Learners*
        * Everything that seems obvious, wasn't always.
    * Creator needs to *stop* making changes and tell Learners to make changes
        * But Creator may not be motivated to do so
        * Creator may be evaluated on his impact and wants to keep producing/fixing himself
* 10x developer
    * 2 types:
        * 10x Developer that is 10x relative to the people they're holding back
        * 10x Team Member who teaches and pulls up the other people in the team
    * If you want to be a great developer: Put The Team First!
        * If other devs get better, the great developer gets to go and do more cool things!
    * Great developers are not born, *they are trained*. They are *symmathesized*.
* Growing a Team
    * A team is not a sum of its parts, it's a product/sum of its relationships
        * Example: the economy is the product of the transaction
        * Example: an ecosystem is the flow of nutrients between members
    * Mutual learning: grow the flows of mutual learning
* Team Learning Approaches
    * Mob programming
        * Everyone in a single room.
        * Only a single typist (take turns).
        * Typist doesn't make decisions.
        * Maximises mutal learning - Mental models synchronise.
    * Technical
        * Domain-driven design.
        * Observability (not needing to know in advance the questions you need to ask).
        * Metrics, logs etc.
* The Renaissance
    * Period of Decompartmentalisation.
        * Broke down the barriers that kept things in oder, but people apart (different trades, crafts etc).
        * Modern equivalent: Java developers, Linux Sysadmins, Database Engineers.
        * Not everyone.
    * Software is not art/craft/engineering.
        * Individual skills are important, but they are not everything.
        * Software is a material unlike anything that humans have had access to before.
        * Our work is the *design* - deciding what to put in.
        * We can get immediate feedback as to what's working.
        * We are Symmathecists.
