# Explore Expand Extract
## Kent Beck

* 3 Phases
    * Explore
        * This is the search for Product Market Fit.
        * Optimise for the max iterations in given runway.
        * Latency is most important metric.
            * If exploring an idea is held up on something, that's bad.
            * Duplication, hackery etc is ok.
        * A concave investment: lots of small investments hoping for a big payoff on one.
        * Try bad ideas - most other people will think they're bad and not try them.
        * KB uses Twitter as a sounding board for ideas - reaction == Good Idea (maybe).
        * You need to be creative and attuned to detecting success but extra hours don't help much.
    * Expand
        * The race to scale.
        * High probability of a high payoff.
        * If you fail you're out of the game.
        * Extra hours *do* help here.
        * 1000x.
    * Extract
        * Continue going but no longer racing to scale.
        * Extracting value form what we've learned in the Expansion phase.
        * 10x - 20x (rather than 1000x).
        * Don't make *courageous* decisions here - there is too much to lose!
            * *"Let's re-design from scratch!"* works in __Expand__ but not here.
        * World becomes more complicated
            * More stakeholders.
            * Products can impact one another.
            * Diminishing returns.
* Different values during different phases.
    * Extreme Programming Values
        * Simplicity
        * Feedback
        * Courage
        * Communication
        * Respect
    * If different phases are underway in different parts of the organisation.
        * KPIs are needed at the *Extract* phase - inappropriate at the *Explore* phase.
        * An ROI explanation at *Explore* phase doesn't make sense. Yu just don't know.
    * You manage a project differently when you have *nothing* to lose vs *everything* to lose.
    * How to manage this with different phases in the same organisation?
        * There are *natural extractors* - people who like to focus on KPIs, useful in *Extract* phase.
        * There are people who are disinterested in *extract* and are better re-directed to *Expand* or *Explore*.
* Facebook
    * Funds lots of *Explore* phases.
    * Ready to re-deploy resources to *Expand* if a hit registered.
        * Difficult for people who own *Extract* phase to lose resources to *Expand*.
    * __Impact__
        * At FB every 6 months you need to demonstrate your *impact*.
        * Outcomes are measured and rewarded (bonus, promotion etc).
        * This is a __great__ idea in *Explore*.
            * You don't want "politicians" that sit around talk about ideas and making decisions without *doing*.
        * This is a __bad__ idea in *Extract*.
            * Incentivises change for it own sake, potentially ignoring the __downside__.
            * Probability of introducing a well-intentioned feature with significant downside increases.
        * At some point you need to reward god *decisions* rather than just good *outcomes*.
