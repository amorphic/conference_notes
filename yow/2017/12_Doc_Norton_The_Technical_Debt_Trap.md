# The Technical Debt Trap
## Doc Norton

> Technical Debt has become a catch-all phrase for any code that needs to be re-worked. Much like refactoring has become a catch-all phrase for any activity that involves changing code. These fundamental misunderstandings and comfortable yet mis-applied metaphors have resulted in a plethora of poor decisions. What is technical debt? What is not technical debt? Why should we care? What is the cost of misunderstanding? What do we do about it?

> Doc discusses the origins of the metaphor, what it means today, and how we properly identify and manage technical debt. In this talk Iâ€™ll share how these four principles power world-famous companies and how they can help you work with greater speed, simplicity, safety and success.

* Technical Debt is
    * A strategic design decisions
        * To get to market and learn
    * A metaphor for *"here be danger..."*
        * But metaphors go wrong
        * Financial metaphor extended
* Fowler's tech debt quadrant
    * Reckless/Prudent vs Deliberate/Inadvertent
* *"Ability to pay back debt depends upon you writing code that is clean enough to be able to refactor as you come to understand your problem"*
    * Refactor changes internal structure without external behaviour
    * Thus clean code and tests are a requirement to repay the debt
        * Otherwise it is not tech debt. It is cruft
        * A Financier vs a Pawnbroker
* Reckless behaviour
    * Deliberate = Irresponsible
    * Inadvertent = Incompetent
    * So neither of these can be Technical Debt. They are cruft.
* Cruft or debt can come down to team standards
    * Some things are acceptable and some are not
* Don't deliberately create cruft
    * Sets precedent for speed over quality
    * We think can move fast - will only work in the short term
    * Expectation of increased velocity
    * Cruft slows you down
    * Must write more cruft to keep up
    * When cruft leads to more cruft
        * You have to ask permission to do your job correctly
* Managing Cruft
    1. Failing strategy: Cleaning iteration
        * Scheduled iterations for tidying
        * Quality deferred to cleaning sprint
        * Focus on speed/velocity at other times
    2. Winning strategy: Clean constantly
        * Never make an intentional mess
        * Monitor you "technical debt"
        * Follow the Boy Scout Rule
        * Never ask permission to do job correctly
* Monitoring Cruft
    * Code Coverage
    * Code Complexity
        * Lines of Code is the key complexity metric!
    * Churn
    * Maintainability
    * Monitor trends, not points
        * Is it trending in the way we expect for the strategy we've chosen?
