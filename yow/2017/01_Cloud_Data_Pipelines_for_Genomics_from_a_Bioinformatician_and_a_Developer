# Cloud Data Pipelines for Genomics from a Bioinformatician and a Developer
## Lynn Langit / Denis Bauer

* Building a platform for use of big data in genomics
    * Looking for 4 letters in 3-billion letter genome
    * Bioninformatician working with Developer to help build platform
* Platform
    * CSIRO [VariantSpark](http://bioinformatics.csiro.au/variantspark)
    * Based on [Databricks](https://databricks.com/) + Apache Spark
	* Future
    	* Python API
	* Spark as a Service doesn't exist
		* Researchers don't have internal IT expertise to tune Spark clusters etc
		* But for now they have to use Spark Server Cluster
* Random Forests
    * Decision Trees are the funamental primitive
        * A -> All people with X
        * B -> All people without X
* Scale
    * 50M vars + 10k samples
    * Scales linearly
    * Economies
    * $9k for a test run on AWS(!)
* GTC-Scan2
    * Genome Search Engine
    * Using standard cloud service too expensive
		* Cost vs Scale
	* Serverless
		* Lambda
		* S3
		* DynamoDBDB
		* API Gateway
	* Logs
		* Amazon Watchlogs
		* Hard to make sense with multiple Lambdas, DBs etc
        * Log readers emerging to deal with noise
			* X-Ray
			* Annotations now possible
		* Use to find functions
			* Being called more often than others
			* Using more time than others
			* Example: 2 mins to 30 sec, 75% $$$ saving
	* Lambdas spawn lambdas
	* Looking at service value
		* State service example
		* Useful, but not enough to justfiy cost
