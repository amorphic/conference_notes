# How Agile Screwed Up Product Ownership, and 5 Things You Can Do to Fix It
## Jeff Patton

> Agile development has fixed lots of problems in software development, Companies using it consistently deliver working software more predictably than ever before, But, the software they make isn’t necessarily better, or more successful in the market. Because the things we need to do to make a product successful aren’t baked into agile development,. And, in fact, strict adherence to common agile practice can result in even worse products.

> This talk explains why and gives you 5 concrete changes to Agile development you can make to improve things. These aren’t things your product owner or product manager must do. They’re the things the whole team need to do. And, they’re not easy things. But, they’re necessary if you want to more consistently make products people love.

* Stop treating product owners like customers
    * Traditional pattern: Client -> Vendor
        * Client's job
            * Know what they want
            * Explain what they want
        * Vendor's job
            * Understand
            * Figure out how long
            * Estimate
        * Process
            1. Vendor does the work (and actually work out if estimate was right)
            2. Keeps their commitment
        * Client can argue for better price. Good for customer.
        * When the business asks for better price, the money is still in the business
    * Business
        * Product Manager/Owner - job is to build a great product
            * Valuable
                * Business Model
                * Vision
                * Understand Users (who will use the product)
                * Understand Choosers (who will choose the product - sometimes different to users)
                * Understand Competitors
            * Usable
                * How they work
                * Their problems
                * Their solutions
            * Feasible
                * Code
                * *Your* code
                * Scope
                * Performance
                * Security
                * Trends
        * This looks impossible because it is!
            * We need to meet with a core product team
                * UX/Designer
                * Senior Engineer
            * With PM this is the Triad/Trio/To3
                * Sometimes more people (or less) depending on product
        * Good products come from the intersection of Valuable/Usable/Feasible
            * PO is a bad term - they don't own the product
            * The whole team (inlclding the PO) own the product
* What we measure 
    * Each sprint we make a Time/Cost/Scope bet
    * This is not product development
        * This starts with customers
        * These products/features/enhancements feed into spec/requirements
    * Measure Outcomes (customer satisfaction) vs Outputs (story points)
    * Measure Impacts (business success)
    * No positive impacts without positive outcomes
    * Story acceptance criteria
        * What will we check to confirm done
        * How will we demonstrate functionality
        * How will we measure value?
    * Don't conflate velocity with value
* Don't assume you're building something worthwhile
    * New ideas
        * Always too many
        * Most suck
        * People in org assume new features will make product awesome
        * Customers assume they'll use features they ask for
        * We're biased to think our ideas will succeed
    * Business needs to be *accountable* for their Hypothesis/Bets
    * New process: Discovery
        * Learning Fast
        * As opposed to agile
            * Delivering Fast
            * Delivering quality (tested)
            * Delivering predictably
        * Learning Backlog
            * Risks
            * Assumptions
            * Questions
            * Process
                1. Hypothesis (Learn)
                2. Test Plan (Build)
                3. Experiment (Measure)
        * Discovery is spikes
            * Used to test feasibility risks
            * Disposable
        * Experiments range from cheap/fast to expsensive/time consuming
            * Interview
            * Show prototype
            * AB Test
            * Higher Fidelity prototype
            * Live data prototype
            * Limited release to user subset
            * Build scalable software
        * Stay in safe zone
            * Don't waste effort on almost sure bets (even on cheap/fast experiments)
            * Don't waste effort on very unsure bets that take a lot of effort 
* Get out of the office
    * Spend time with your customers
    * Hunan empathy
    * You'll never think of the product the same way
* Stop hiding work from the team
    * Don't do customer interviews without a developer in the room
    * Create customer personas
        * Identify a customer type
        * Their wants and needs

* Books
