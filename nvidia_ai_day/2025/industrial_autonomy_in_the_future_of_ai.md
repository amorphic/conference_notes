- In the millions of factories around the world there is no evidence of computing technology
  - Apart from 
- Physical AI
  - Input
    - Sensor signals 
     - Image tokens
     - Text tokens
     - Audio tokens?
  - Output
    - Actuator signals
     - Servo motors
     - etc
  - Robots
   - Basic
   - Robotic arms etc
   - Humanoid
   - With sensors and actuators a room, building or city can be considered a robot
- Industrial shift
  - Labour shortage
    - Dull
    - Dirty
    - Dangerous
  - Reshoring manufacturing
  - Change in robot strategy
    - Robots we developed before were very difficult to program
      - Painstakingly programmed by robotics specialists
      - Robots have no "vision"
      - Tasks are very specific and repetitive
    - Even if robots were physically good
    - We could make a good robot body but not a good robot brain
