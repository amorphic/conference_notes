Building Quantum Computing's Future

- There are problems that can't be solved with classical computers
  - Even if they are applied to AI
- Why not just use Quantum?
  - They're expensive and hard to build
- Appliations w/AI
  - Quantum is a highly accurate simulation of the chemistry in the lab
  - We can potentially going to generate  high-precision, reliable data
  - This data might feed machine learning systems
- Why not yet?
  - Too small: (hundreds of cubits)
  - Too noisy: errors after a few hundred operations
- PsiQuantum want to make quantum computers with millions of error-corrected cubits
  - This requires lots of problems to be solved at scale
  - Using photonics
    - High performance silicon photonics
    - Photons need to come off photonic chips and on to fibre optics
    - Tier 1 Semiconductor Manufacturing
    - Switching
      - Similar to conventions
  - Cooling
   - Photons detected by thermal wire which needs to operate at very low temperature 
- Plans
  - Strong history in Quantum 
  - Site near Brisbane airport
   - Cryo plant coming first
