Rev Lebaredian, NVIDIA VP of Omniverse and Simulation Tech 

- "Intelligence Factories"
  - Moving from "Data Centres" to "Intelligence Factories"
      - Electricity in -> Tokens (knowledge) out
        - Australia is *well placed* for this:
          - Power
          - Space
          - Startup Ecosystem
  - Omniverse as "digital twin" to test AI + robots before deployment
  - "Rather than just adding tools to humans we are adding participants"
      - In teams, enterprises, economies
      - Rather than just upskill humans, add new participants
        - In knowledge work: Agents
        - In physical work: Robots
      - Jobs that are too boring, too dirty, too dangerous
