  - Float
    - First in Intel 8087
    - Changed paradigm
    - Tensor, Transformer, LLM
  - Quantum
- Planes inform "the right tool for the right job"
 - AI is intelligence but it's not human intelligence
 - This is important when we think about what problems are right and wrong for AI
 - "Software People" and "AI People" are the same
  - These will crossover more and more
 - What does this masssive amount of compute and token-based intelligence unlock?
- Loops
  - Tools 
    - Normal Software (completely deterministic)
     - Expensive to build
     - Very cheap to run
    - Predictive Models
    - Specialised Generative Models
    - Large General Models
    - Humans
  - Loops
    - Using Large General Models to create "Normal Software"
    - 
  - Future
    - Start with mega-computer "Large General Models" architecture
      - This is expensive 
    - Transactive Memory
      - Example: Instead of knowing all the names of TV actors, know a "reference" to another human who does
      - Negotiating with AI individually, in our companies, across economies
    - From MCP and A2A - now we need H2A, A2H, A2A
    - From agents to swams is all about queues
    - Moore's law may be dead but Jerven's paradox will hold
