Talks
High-Performance, Quantum- and AI-Driven Drug Discovery [AD21016]
Drug discovery hinges on modelling and manipulating matter at bioscale. Yet current computational approaches are too slow or insufficiently accurate, forcing costly experiments. We present a digital chemistry framework that unites many-GPU high-performance computing, quantum chemistry, and machine learning, with novel algorithms and software optimizations that remove long-standing cost and efficiency barriers to scalable quantum methods. Recognized with the 2024 ACM Gordon Bell Prize, this work enabled the first quantum-accurate simulations of biomolecular systems with fidelity approaching experiment and the first exaflop-scale computation in double precision. Through exascale supercomputing, automated workflows, and ML trained on quantum-accurate data, the platform delivers automatable, adaptive, cost-effective models of complex phenomena. The result is accelerated discovery, stronger molecular design, and a redefined horizon for in-silico research across chemistry and biology.

    Accelerating Drug Discovery With GPU-Powered, Sequence-Based Deep Learning Models [AD21006]
    Predicting how small molecules interact with proteins is a key challenge in drug discovery, especially when structural information is lacking. Existing approaches often require detailed protein structures and offer limited interpretability. We introduce PSICHIC, a graph neural network that leverages GPU acceleration to efficiently learn the patterns of protein–molecule interactions using only sequence data. By integrating core physical and chemical constraints, PSICHIC achieves top-tier performance in predicting binding strength and provides interpretable insights into the mechanisms behind these interactions. Our findings demonstrate that GPU-powered, sequence-based deep learning models can match—and even surpass—traditional structure-dependent methods, pointing to a new era of speed and insight for AI-driven drug discovery. We'll also highlight how the next generation of GPUs can accelerate the process even further.
