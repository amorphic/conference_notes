# The Future of Making
## Professor Neil Gershenfeld - MIT

Extended talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDjOS0VHEr4

- Problem: people were learning at Fab Academy and then "dropping off"
 - Attempted to connect makers with traditional entrepreneurs but this didn't always work
 - Went from meausuring number of Fablabs
 - To measuring the programs run at Fablabs
- Fab 2.0 Portal
 - "Advanced" Fab Labs that can create Fab Lab machines
  - More expensive regional labs that can allow local labs to be created cheaper
  - Use the tools in an advanced Fab Lab to create the tools for a local fab lab
 - Fab Lab in a Box
  - All basic resources
  - Importantly includes "teacher in a box" (which is actually all teahing materials that anyone can use to teach)
 - Open Lab Starter Kit

- Fab 3.0
 - "From printing and cutting to assembling and disassembling"
 - E.g. circuits, chips and other things with global, long supply chains
 - Build a chip or a circuit from smaller building blocks
 - AI 
  - We should not be surprised that the AI revolution followed 
  - Assembly speed: 
   - Chip fab: 10^10/s
   - Human cel fab: 10^18/s
    - "There's no trash in a forest"
    - Cellural life assembled from 
  - Von Neumann's last study
   - "Celluar Automata" 
   - "How a computation can communicate its own construction"
  - Turing's last study
   - "EvoDevo"
   - Developmental programs let evolution discover designs
   - WIll this be the heart of how engineering design will work in the future
 - We think of these as distinct but the future is a seamless merging of physical and digital:
  - Computing
  - Communication
  - Fabrication
- The goal is a world where "everybody can make anything"
 - How do we "live, play and work in this ^ world"? 
 - We don't need to wait for this to apply lessons learned in the world of digital fabrication
- How do you encourage people to be makers rather than consumers?
 - "Show, don't tell"
 - Example: poor community in Spain
  - Community protested FabLab in preference of a Food Bank
  - Once they understood the potential for self-sustaining food as well as creating toys, furtniture etc, the conversation changed
- US proposal
 - National network of FabLabs as urban infrastrucutre
 - Interestingly these seem to bridge the divide between Conservatism and Liberalism
 - Problem: traditional industry views these as toys
- Creativity + Compassion
 - AI Tooling
  - AI + Human is powerful
 - Job is work is money is consumption
  - This is a relatively new paradigm for humans
  - Traditionally everything is produced locally and based on the wisdom of community
   - A world we live in which isn't goverend by faceless engineers far away
   - You can create the world around you
 - FabLab (All In) approach: Distributed Grass Roots, mentored and curated
  - "Do it yourself" at its extreme causes unnecessary re-production
  - "Hierarchy" creates needless barriers
